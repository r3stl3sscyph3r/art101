			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I problems getting started as I've been very busy with housing and other unrelated issues I needed to manage. But, once I got started it was pretty easy for me to handle.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab wasn't very hard after the previous lab as I already have all my file structure organized. And messed with the homepage of my website occaisonally before this. I put in as much energy as I could, not as much as the previous lab due to outside circumstances, but I still think I did well. </p>
